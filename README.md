# Machine-Learning

My own code implementing different methods from ML/AI/statistics on different datasets. Everything here is implemented with Google's TensorFlow library.

Geolocation : Code I wrote for a research project on tweet geolocation when I was at SMaPP Lab.

MNIST : Handwritten digits unpacked as vectors. Label is digit.

South-African-Heart-Disease : Health data. Label is heart-disease or no heart-disease.

tensorflow : Code for basic machine learning objects, like logistic_regression(), linear_regression(), hidden_layer(), etc.
