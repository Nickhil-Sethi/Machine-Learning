# Machine-Learning

My own code implementing different methods from ML/AI/statistics on different datasets.

Everything here is implemented with Google's TensorFlow library; files beginning with tf (e.g. tf_neural_network.py) denote modules I've written to code basic machine learning objects, like logistic_regression(), linear_regression(), hidden_layer(), etc.

MNIST : handwritten digits unpacked as vectors. Label is digit.

South-African-Heart-Disease : health data. Label is heart-disease or no heart-disease.
